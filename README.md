Learn algorithms with Python

 - Creating this repository for educational purposes.
 
 - This repository contains code written in Python to implement common Algorithms and Data Structures.

 - The repository is intended to serve as a guide for anyone who wants to learn algorithms and their implementation in Python.

The code contained in this library can be used as practice material along while studying these amazing courses by Prof. Sedgewick and Dr. Wayne:
 - https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1
 
 - https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2

The preferred language for these courses is Java though. So putting this code as a help for anyone interested in Python implementation of this coursework.
